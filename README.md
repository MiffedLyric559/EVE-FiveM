## How to:

1. Download & install [Voukoder](https://github.com/Vouk/voukoder/releases)

2. Download & install [C++ Runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

3. Download version 0.5.2 of [Extended Video Export](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/extended-video-export)

4. Locate your `FiveM Application Data` folder

5. Create a `plugins` folder inside the `FiveM Application Data` folder, if you havenâ€™t got one already.

6. Extract the `ExtendedVideoExport.asi` file in to the `plugins` folder

7. Extract the `EVE` folder to `plugins` as well. There is no need to place EVE folder in data/cache/subprocesses anymore!

8. Open `ExtendedVideoExport.ini` search for **output_folder** and after it **=** put the folder path where you want your video to be exported once the export is finished. Example: `output_folder = C:\eveexports` the folder you specify needs to exist!
